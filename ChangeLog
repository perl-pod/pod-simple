	of Pod::Escapes.  Spotted by Petr Pisar++

3.37 2019-05-30 Karl Williamson <khw@cpan.org>

3.35 2016-11-29  Karl Williamson <khw@cpan.org>
	- Needed to 'make manifest' before uploading to CPAN.  No changes beyond
	version bump

3.34 2016-11-29  Karl Williamson <khw@cpan.org>
	- Stabilize t/search50.t.  Thanks to rurban for the patch!
	- Turn off utf8 warnings when trying to see if a file is UTF-8 or not.

3.32 2015-11-02   Marc Green <marcgreen@cpan.org>
	- Fixed failing tests on Windows. Thanks to A. Sinan Unur for the
	patch!

	- Switched debugging output from STDOUT to STDERR. Should rarely be
	used, but modules that do depend on debugging output might need to
	change how they handle it. Patch from Karl Williamson (GitHub Pull
	Request #76).

	- Added errata_seen() to make POD errors easily accessible. Thanks to
	Sean Zellmer for the pull request!

3.31 2015-08-23   Marc Green <marcgreen@cpan.org>
	- No changes since 3.30_1.

3.30_1 2015-07-19   Marc Green <marcgreen@cpan.org>
	- Simplified the detection of case-insensitivity in Pod::Simple::Search.

	- Fixed "Use of uninitialized value $1 in lc" warning in
	Pod::Simple::Search.

	- If @INC includes the current directory symbol, '.', the survey()
	method of Pod::Simple::Search no longer excludes it from its list
	of directories to search. Instead, The survey() and find() methods
	now both exclude duplicate directories from @INC (RT #102344).

	- Moved source repository and updated links to new perl-pod GitHub
	organization: https://github.com/perl-pod/pod-simple.

	- Improved repository links and added GitHub issue tracking link to
	the distribution metadata.

	- Switched from File::Spec's catdir to catfile for path names, to
	fix failures on VMS. Also now use Unix path semantics where
	they're not required to be platform-specific. Thanks to Craig A.
	Berry for the patch (RT #105511).

	- Improved the example use of the 'html_encode_chars()' method in
	the Pod::Simple::XHTML documentation. Patch from Randy Stauner.

3.30 2015-02-23   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- No changes since 3.29_6.

3.29_6 2015-02-19   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- The survey() method in Pod::Simple::Search now ignores duplicate
	files with varying lettercasing on case-insensitive file systems.
	This allows

	- When pondering files in a given directory, the survey() method in
	Pod::Simple::Search now prefers files with extensions in the
	following order: no extension, .pod, .pm, .plx, .pl.

	- The find() method in Pod::Simple::Search now records the './pod'
	subdirectory of each directory it considers in such a way as to
	preserve its case on the file system.

	- The find() method in Pod::Simple::Search now tries harder to find
	the proper file on case-insensitive file systems when searching
	for modules starting with "Pod". For example, when searching for
	'Pod::Perldoc' it now returns a file ending in 'Pod/Perldoc.pm'
	instead of 'Pod/perldoc.pod', as the latter is actually the
	documention for the 'perldoc' program.

3.29_5 2015-02-17   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- No changes except that the release tarball should no longer be empty.

3.29_4 2015-02-16   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Removed "Caveats" from the docs. Pod::Simple has been out of beta
	for years.

	- The survey() method in Pod::Simple::Search no longer assumes that
	files ending in '.pod' are actually Pod. Like .pm and .pl files,
	.pod files must contains at least one valid POD command, as
	documented. This brings the behavior in line with find(), which
	already required that .pod files contain Pod.

	- The survey() method in Pod::Simple::Search now prefers files
	ending in .pod over those ending in .pm, and .pm over those ending
	in .pl, when it finds duplicate pod files for a given name.

3.29_3 2015-02-11   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Tightened up the first pass at recognizing a Pod command so that
	fewer invalid Pod lines will be recognized. Suggested by Randy
	Stauner.

	- Fixed bug where Pod::Simple would attempt to call
	utf8::unicode_to_native on Perl 5.6, where that function does not
	exist.

	- Typos and minor wordsmithing changes in Pod::Simple::Subclassing,
	thanks to Randy Stauner.

	- The Pod::Simple::Search survey() and find() methods now use the same
	code for determining @INC directories to search. The only difference
	is that find() also includes $Config::Config{'scriptdir'}.

3.29 2015-01-13   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- NOTE: This will be the last release of Pod::Simple to support versions
	of Perl earlier than 5.6.

	- Fixed test failure for unsupported encoding on Perl 5.6.

	- Removed unnecessary dependency on constant. Reported by Petr Pisar
	(RT #85578).

	- Many documentation and comment typos fixed by David Steinbrunner.

	- Fixed issue when an encoding is declared via an '=encoding' directive
	*after* Pod::Simple has already detected an encoding. Thanks to
	Graham Knop for the patch and Patrice Dumas for the tests.

	- Added '>&STDERR' as an output to better emulate
	Pod::Parser::parse_from_file(). Florent Angly.

	- Tidied the description of the different Pod::Simple interfaces,
	with greater emphasis on the four different steps to subclassing.
	Florent Angly.

	- Added the 'top_anchor' attribue to Pod::Simple::HTML, to allow
	specification of a custom top anchor format. Gabor Szabo.

	- Fixed the text formatter to properly set the Text::Wrap overflow policy.
	Thanks to Nigel Metheringham for the fix!

	- Fixed mis-matched quotation marks when adding JavaScript elements
	to the XHTML output. Patch from jonathancast.

	- Fixed issues on EBCDIC. Patch from Karl Williamson (GitHub Pull
	Request #58).

	- Fixed bug where the value passed to Pod::Simple::XHTML's
	html_css() method would be output twice. Thanks to Andrew Johnson
	for the report (RT #99303).

	- Documented the 'recurse' attribute of Pod::Simple::Search.
	Thanks to Jim Keenan for the report (RT #91886).

	- An error is no longer thrown when '=encoding' directives are found
	on subsequent lines. Instead, we now log a an error message,
	"Cannot have multiple =encoding directives" (RT #91757).

	- The HTML and XHTML formatters now do a better job of preserving
	lines in 'begin html' blocks. Fixes a bug that dates from 2002
	(Perl RT#9385, CPAN RT #91851).

3.28 2013-05-04   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Removed use of 'done_testing' in t/white.t, which was added in
	v3.27. Thanks to Paul Howarth for the catch.

	- Fixed inproperly calculated number of skipped tests in t/xhtml01.t
	when HTML::Entities is not intalled.

3.27 2013-05-03   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Added new warnings as defined by Pod::Checker, thanks to RJBS:
		+ "=over" without "=back"
		+ "L<>" starts or ends with whitespace
		+ raw "|" or "/" in "L<text|link>" text

	- Added ->keep_encoding_directive, which is false by default, to
	prevent formatters from emitting a document's '=encoding'
	directive in most cases. That they emitted the encoding was a bug
	introduced in v3.26 (RT #84093). Now, only the DumpAsText and
	DumpAsXML formats set it to true. Patch from Patrice Dumas.

3.26 2013-02-27   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Fixed another test script to skip all tests when Encode is not
	installed.

	- Added 'encoding()' and 'detected_encoding()' to return the current
	encoding and the encoding actually to decode the input file. The
	value from "=encoding" is also now kept in the output tree. Patch
	from Patrice Dumas (RT #74390).

3.25 2013-02-16   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Improved the warning when "=item" types mismatch within one
	"=over"/"=back" block.

3.24 2013-02-14   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Fixed corner case bug for unlikely scenario in which non-UTF-8
	text could be parsed as UTF-8. Grant McLean.

	- XHTML IDs can no longer end with punctuation. Thanks to Smylers
	for the patch.

	- Fixed test failure on Perl 5.6.2.

	- Changed the default installation location from "perl" to "site" on
	5.12 and higher, since as of that version of Perl, dual-life
	modules no longer need to be installed in "perl" to replace
	in-core versions. Patch from tzccinct.

	- Fixed hash order dependency test failures on Perl 5.17. Thanks to
	Yves Orton for the patch.

	- Inlined the code that tries to guess a Pod file's encoding. This
	reduces the time Pod::Simple takes to build the core Perl
	documentation by 15-20%. Thanks to Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker for
	the patch!

	- Added a warning when "=item" types mismatch within one
	"=over"/"=back" block. Marc Green/Google Summer of Code, with
	assist from RJBS.

	- Fixed regression introduced in 3.22 in which "C< >" tags were
	incorrectly treated as verbatim text in table of contents items
	emitted by Pod::Simple::XHTML. Thanks to Randy Stauner for the
	report and to Thomas Sibley for the fix!

	- Loosened up the matching of "L< >" tags for man pages so that they
	allow names with dots, underscores, and any other chararacters
	other than "/", just so long as they end in '[(][-a-zA-Z0-9]+[)]'.
	Thanks to Dave Rolsky and Kevin Ryde for the reports (RT #82975 &
	RT #82972).

	- Fixed inverted mapping of "keyboard" to "kbd" in
	Pod::Simple::HTML. Thanks to Robert Boisvert for the bug report
	(RT #79201).

	- Added two new Tagmap entries to Pod::Simple::HTML: "preformat"
	maps to "pre", and "teletype" maps to "tt". Suggested by Robert
	Boisvert (RT #79201).

	- "X< >" tags are now ignored by the pull parser when it searches
	for titles, as is any trailing whitespace. Thanks to Patrice Dumas
	for the report (RT #74389).

3.23 2012-08-14   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Eliminated nested elements in table of contents (index) items
	output of Pod::Simple::XHTML. This was especially problematic for
	headers that included links, as the TOC then got nested anchor
	elements, which simply would not work. Thanks to Ben Bullock for
	the report and test case (RT #77686).

	- Fixed semantically invalid nested XHTML generated by
	Pod::Simple::XHTML since v3.21. Gisle Aas.

	- Improved support for nested "C< >" tags in Pod::Simple::XHTML.
	Gisle Aas.

	- No longer tries to decode a string with the "utf8" flag set, as
	the double-decoding only triggered an error. Grant McLean.

	- Added documentation note that the API expects encoded text
	(octets). Grant McLean.

	- Added "parse_characters()" option to specify that strings to are
	already decoded from octets into characters. Grant McLean.

3.22 2012-05-27   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Fix but where Pod::Simple would whine about non-ASCII bytes in
	code or comments. Now only does so for Pod (in the absence of an
	"=encoding" tag. Broken in 3.21. Grant McLean.

3.21 2012-05-23   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- NOTE: COMPATABILITY CHANGE: The 'codes_in_verbatim' option in
	Pod::Simple::XHTML is no longer enabled by default. This brings it
	agreement with the other formatting classes, and eliminates
	unexpected behavior in XHTML-formatted Pod. Users who depended on
	this functionality can still get it by enabling
	'codes_in_verbatim' in their code.

	- Fixed some typos in the documentation. Thanks to Jonathan Yu via
	the Debian packagers via Florian Ragwitz (RT #75532).

	- Now emit a warning the first time a non-ASCII byte is encountered
	when no "=encoding" has been seen. Grant McLean.

	- When a non-ASCII byte is encounted before an "=encoding" line has
	been seen, a heuristic (as described in perlpodspec) is applied to
	select UTF-8 encoding if the non-ASCII bytes form a valid UTF-8
	byte sequence, or Latin-1 otherwise. Grant McLean.

	- Added 'handle_code' method to Pod::Simple::XHTML. This allows
	subclasses to override the handling of verbatim blocks, and makes
	for a more cohesive interface, to boot. Gisle Aas.

	- Subsequent text segments are now joined together and passed as a
	single unit to text handling code. This makes it easier for custom
	handlers to process complete blocks of text in a single call to
	'handle_text', rather than in dribs and drabs. Gisle Aas.

	- Replaced naive text wrapping code in Pod::Simple::DumpAsXML with
	Text::Wrap, which was already used for similar purposes elsewhere
	in Pod::Simple. Gisle Aas.

3.20 2012-03-01   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Removed use of 'done_testing' in t/xhtml15.t, which was added in
	v3.19. Thanks to Paul Howarth for the catch.

	- Fixed quoting of links in a regular expression Pod::Simple::Text.
	Reported by Father Chrysostomos.

	- Fix test failure on case-insensitive, non-case-preserving file systems
	(VMS I'm looking at *you*). Patch from Craig A. Berry.

	- Pod::Simple::HTML no longer emits "href='#___top'" if a TOC
	(index) is not output. Patch from Rick Myers.

	- Fixed links in the TOC of XHTML output to use IDs derived from encoded
	text, rather than raw Pod, so that it will link to the ID actually
	generated for the section. Thanks to Randy Stauner for the report
	(with test case!) (RT #72544).

	- PullParser now throws an exception on an attempt to set a source
	more than once. Necessary because data from the previous source
	will be cached, so the new source would be ignored anyway. Create a
	new PullParser, instead. Thanks to Paul Boldra for the report (RT
	#74265).

3.19 2011-08-23   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Fixed occasional test failure when tests are run in parallel
	(HARNESS_OPTIONS=j6:c). Thanks to Alexei Znamensky for the report and
	Marc Green for the fix.

	- Added "pod_handler" option. This is a callback that can be used to
	inspect the content on a "=pod" line. Marc Green/Google Summer of
	Code.

	- Added tests for proper line-ending parsing from the previous
	release. The tests were in the repository, but didn't make it into
	the MANIFEST or, therefore, the release. Reported by Marc Green.

	- Added the "parse_empty_lists" option. When enabled, Pod::Simple
	will recognize empty lists (that is, a blocks with '=over' and
	'=back' but nothing in between). Disabled by default. Marc
	Green/Google Summer of Code.

	- Added the "whiteline_handler" attribute. It's much like
	"code_handler", "cut_handler", and "pod_handler", except it's
	triggered on lines that contain only whitespace characters. Marc
	Green/Google Summer of Code.

	- Added "raw" attribute to L<> treelet that contains the L<>'s raw
	contents. Marc Green/Google Summer of Code.

	- Pod directives autoclosed by Pod::Simple are now denoted as such
	by the new "fake_closer" attribue. Marc Green/Google Summer of
	Code.

	- Fixed incompatibility with Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch in
	Pod::Simple::XHTML. Patch by Eric Johnson.

3.18 2011-07-16   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Pod::Simple now properly parses Pod files using Mac OS Classic line-
	endings (\r). Marc Green/Google Summer of Code.

	- Fixed test failure in 't/search50.t when the test finds a .pod but
	the module is in a .pm. Thanks to the cpan-testers who reported
	this when the test searched for Capture::Tiny.

3.17 2011-07-09   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Documented tertiary methods. Patch from Shawn H Corey.

	- Added "backlink" option to Pod::Simple::XHTML. Thanks to Marc
	Green/Google Summer of Code for the pull request.

	- Typos fixed in Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch. Reported by Shawn H Corey.

	- Fixed quoting of value returned by a "strip_verbatim_indent()"
	code reference so that regex meta characters are properly escaped.

	- Added "anchor_items" option to Pod::Simple::XHMTL. This allows
	text items (which are output as <dt> elements) to have IDs that
	can be referenced in the "#" part of a URL. Marc Green/Google
	Summer of Code.

	- Added "recurse" option to Pod::Simple::Search. It's enabled by
	default; disable it to turn off recursion into subdirectories.
	Marc Green/Google Summer of Code.

	- Added documentation to clarify the behavior of the "content_seen"
	method. Thanks to Olaf Alders for the pull request.

3.16 2011-03-14   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Fixed invalid HTML generated for nested lists by Pod::Simple::XHTML
	(Fitz Elliott).

	- Replaced the invalid "<nobr>" tag -- created for "S<>" -- with
	'<span style="white-space: nowrap;">' (Fitz Elliott).

	- Fixed some nerbles in our own Pod (Michael Stevens)

	- Improved the "Minimal code" example in Pod::Simple::HTML. The key
	is to use pase_file(), not parse_from_file() (which should
	otherwise be undocumented, and is just there for Pod::Parser
	compatibility. Thanks to prodding from Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (RT
	#65428).

	- Added the html_charset() and html_encode_chars() attributes to
	Pod::Simple::XHTML. Inspired by a bug report from Agent Zhang
	(章亦春) (RT #29587).

	- Added "Minimal code" example to the Pod::Simple::XHTML documentation.

	- Fixed mispelling of the "=encoding" markup in the parser (it was
	spelled "=encode"). Thanks to "TTY" for the patch. (RT #24820).

3.15 2010-11-11   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Removed "perlpod.pod" and "perlpodspec.pod". These now just live
	in the Perl core.

	- Fixed stylesheet names output by HTMLBatch to match the names of
	the actual stylesheet files (broken in 3.09). Thanks to Kevin Ryde
	for the report (RT #56725).

	- Added missing closing slash to the CSS links in the XHTML output.
	Thanks to HarleyPig for the patch!

	- Added parens around bar "qw(...)" in t/xhtml05.t. Thanks to Jerry
	D. Hedden for the patch.

	- Improved the Pod::Simple::HTML docs. Thanks to Gabor Szabo for the
	patch.

	- Pod::Simple::XHTML now properly encodes entities in URLs in the
	anchor tag. Thanks to John McNamara for the report (RT-60249).

	- Pod::Simple::HTML and XHTML now strip whitespace from the end of
	section names that appear as anchor names for headers (in HTML)
	and IDs (in XHTML). Such whitespace appeared when "X<>" entities
	were stripped out but not the space between them (RT-56572).

	- Make test "t/search50.t" always pass on case-insensitive file
	systems rather than just skip VMS.

3.14 2009-04-27
	- Removed explicit loading of UNIVERSAL. RJBS.

	- Reversed the change applied in release 3.09 to fix RT #12239. POD
	tag found inside a complex POD tag (e.g., "C<<< I<foo> >>>") is
	again parsed as a tag embedded in a tag instead of text and
	entities. The previous interpretation of `perldoc perlpod` was
	mistaken. (RT #55602 from Christopher J. Madsen).

3.13 2009-12-17   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Removed deleted test file from MANIFEST.

3.12 2009-12-17   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Removed "All rights reserved" from all files.

	- Added acknowledgements to man.he.net and search.cpan.org for
	permission to link man pages and Perl module links to their sites
	in the output of Pod::Simple::HTML and Pod::Simple::XHTML.

	- Add "html_h_level" option to Pod::Simple::XHTML and ::HTML to allow
	a =head1 to become an <h2> and so on. RJBS.

	- Add batch_mode_page_object_init() method to Pod::Simple::XHTML.
	This allows it to be used by Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch.

	- Fixed a regression in Pod::Simple::XHTML where '=begin html' blocks
	were incorrectly escaped rather than simply passed through unmolested.
	RJBS.

	- Removed the undocumented "fullstop_space_harden" attribute, which
	apparently was only used by Pod::Text a very long time ago.

3.11 2009-12-09   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Restored code to HTMLBatch that allows the TOC (index) to be created
	in batch jobs (RT #52324 from Martin J. Evans).

	- Added resources to META.yml, including bug tracker, license, and
	repository.

	- Turned man page links into links to man.he.net in Pod::Simple::HTML
	and Pod::Simple::XHTML output. Subclass and override
	resolve_man_page_link() to use a different URL.

	- Added the resolve_pod_page_link() and resolve_man_page_link() methods
	to Pod::Simple::XHTML to make it easier for subclasses to change the
	URLs created for POD and man page links.

	- Fixed the output of entities in L<> tags by Pod::Simple::XHTML.

	- Fixed the output of POD links from Pod::Simple::XHTML so that the
	section part (/foo) is turned into a proper fragment identifier (#foo)
	in the resulting search.cpan.org link.

	- Pod::Simple::Text now outputs URLs for links created in the
	L<text|URL> format. For example, L<Perl|http://perl.org> is now
	output as "Perl <http://perl.org>" rather than just as "Perl".

	- Updated perlpod.pod and perlpodspec.pod to sync up with Perl core
	(and to be released in Perl 5.12). Changes include:
		* Removing the prohibition against L<text|href>
		* Deprecation of L<section> and L<"section">
		* Legalization of "=begin formatname parameter"

	- A couple of bug fixes in Pod::Simple::HTML from Graham Barr.

	- Added the do_section() method to Pod::Simple::HTML. Graham Barr.

	- Word-smithed the "DESCRIPTION" a bit and wrote the README.

	- Synced up all module version numbers to 3.11 except for
	Pod::Simple::HTMLLegacy, which is at 5.01 and should not have its
	version number lowered.

3.10 2009-11-12   David E. Wheeler <david@justatheory.org>
	- Converted test files that had DOS endings to have Unix endings
	(RT #50922 from Steve Hay).

	- Skip tests on VMS where the lack of filename case preservation can
	wreak havoc (RT #51184 from Craig A. Berry).

	- Fix nested definition list format in the XHTML output
	(RT #51187 from Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ).

	- Added some files missing from the MANIFEST (and therefore the
	distribution) in the last two releases.

3.09 2009-10-27   Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>
	- Add support for an index (TOC) in the XHTML output from David E.
	Wheeler.

	- Add strip_verbatim_indent() from David E. Wheeler.

	- Added the "nocase" option to PullParser's get_title(),
	get_version(), get_description(), and get_author() methods. This
	allows one to fetch the contents of those sections regardless of
	the case of the labels (e.g., "NAME" and "Name" and "name" are all
	valid). Graham Barr.

	- Added the search_class() accessor to Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch.
	David E. Wheeler.

	- XHTML output now properly encodes entities in all places, not just
	in verbatim blocks and code spans. David E. Wheeler.

	- Fixed XHTML to output definition lists when it should, rather than
	(broken) unordered lists. David E. Wheeler.

	- Fixed XHTML so that multiparagraph list items work correctly.
	David E. Wheeler.

	- Fixed XHTML ordered list output so that it does not include the
	number specified in the POD in the output. This is on a par with
	out the HTML output works. David E. Wheeler.

	- Applied URL patch from Leon Brocard for The Perl Journal archives.

	- Fixed test failures with older versions of HTML::Entities (RT #43903
	from Salvador Tercia).

	- Changed CSS files generated by HTMLBatch to be no more than 8.3
	characters long. (RT #40450 from Renee Baecker)

	- Added entity handling for E<sol> and E<verbar> to Pod::Simple::XHTML.
	(RT #49615 from Chas Owens.)

	- Fixed a bug in Pod::Simple::HTML where a definition term item with
	no corresponding definition item would be output with no closing
	</a></dt>. (RT # 37107 from Kevin Ryde).

	- Added entity handling for numeric entities to Pod::Simple::XHTML,
	following perlpod specification.

	- A POD tag found inside a complex POD tag (e.g., "C<<< C<foo> >>>")
	is now properly parsed as text and entities instead of a tag
	embedded in a tag. This is in compliance with `perldoc perlpod`
	(RT #12239 from Michael Schwern).

	- Thanks to David E. Wheeler for applying patches, resolving bugs,
	and generally getting ready for the release.

3.08 2009-07-16   Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>
	- Fix installdirs for Perl versions where Pod::Simple was core;
	RT#36446 & RT#39709, thanks to Jerry Hedden.

	- Fix encoding handling for code in paragraphs; RT#45829, thanks
	to David Wheeler.

3.07 2008-06-04   Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>
	- Fix module dependencies, make HTML::Entities optional and require
	Test::More.

3.06 2008-06-03   Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>
	- Fix bugs related to passing $1 to File::Spec, reported by Andrew Hamlin and
	John McNamara.

	- Applied a suggested fix from Kevin Ryde to return a successful exit
	code when Pod::Simple::HTML is run from the command line.

	- Fix handling of complex L<URL> entries, thanks to tests supplied in RT#4896.

	- Fix incorrect handling of S<> entries made up of entirely whitespace, thanks
	to test case from Andreas Koenig.

	- Launch Pod::Simple::XHTML, an XHTML compliant, more easily extensible
	HTML formatter.

	- Add feature to parse additional text after =begin target as a block
	title, requested by Adam Kennedy.

	- Thanks to Hans Dieter Pearcey for applying patches, resolving bugs,
	and generally getting ready for the release.

3.05 2007-03-03   Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>
	- Standardized all test files on 8.3 naming scheme for Perl core.

	- Applied test patches from Jerry Hedden for Perl core when
	Encode not installed.

	- Applied test patch from Ken Williams for 5.005_04 compatibility.

	- Applied a patch from Christopher Madsen to fix architecture
	directory searches on Gentoo.

	- Fixed a failing search test on Debian-based distributions caused
	by Debian stripping Pod documentation out of core modules.
	(Three cheers to the CPAN testers and James Ponza for sending
	enough reports that I could work out the pattern.)

3.04 2006-01-18   Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>
	- Applied test patches for Perl core integration from Steve Peters.

	- Added a 'reinit' method to Pod::Simple::BlackBox for Russ Allbery
	so Pod::Man can provide backward compatibility to existing users
	(such as Module::Build and ExtUtils::MakeMaker).

	- Applied patch for extracting case-preserved package names on VMS
	from Craig Berry.

3.03 2005-11-21   Allison Randal <allison@perl.org>

3.02 2004-05-24   Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	- Just fixing some typos in the CSS generated by Pod::Simple:HTMLBatch.

3.01 2004-05-24   Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	- No big changes to the main modules, but there's many changes to
	the important Pod::Simple::HTML module.

	- Also, new modules:
	  - Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch
	  - Pod::Simple::HTMLLegacy
	  - Pod::Simple::Progress
	  - Pod::Simple::Search
	- and tests for these (well, most).

	- Some prettying up of the Makefile.PL.

	- The test 00about.t is a bit more careful and verbose now.

	- The docs are still incomplete, esp. for Pod::Simple::HTML and
	Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch, which I hope to improve quite soon.
	
	
	
2.06 2004-05-07   Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	- Allison Randal brilliantly refactors a huge monolithic sub in
	Blackbox.pm.  Code is now actually sanely readable!

	- I add the new option-attributes fullstop_space_harden and
	codes_in_verbatim, and the two methods abandon_output_string and
        abandon_output_fh.  Not yet documented.

	- New test fullstop_spaces.t and new corpus document
	greek_iso_8859_7.pod.
	
	- Another version should be forthcoming in a few days that has the
	new Pod::Simple::HTML stuff in it.

	- Note to self: document =extend and =encoding in perlpodspec ASAP!

	
2.05 2003-11-04  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org> -- bugfix version
	- In an attempt to stop Perl 5.6 versions from going completely
	crazy, I've tried to basically turn off all Unicode/utf8 support
	under 5.6. Under 5.8 and above, Unicode should work fine, and
	under 5.6, all Unicode characters should be replaced with a little
	"can't render" symbol, either a "¤" or a "?".
	Many many thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi for helping out.

	- (Works under 5.005 now too?)
	
2.04 2003-10-10  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org> -- minor bugfix version
	* Added some code to insulate Pod::Simple to runtime changes in
	the value of $/.  Thanks to Iain Truskett for catching this.
	* Added FILENO method to TiedOutFH.pm, to work quietly under some
	perls.  Thanks to Jochen Stenzel for catching this.
	* Fixed some tests that erroneously failed under some 5.6's
	because of chdir()s in *.t files messing up @INC  Thanks to many
	who caught this, including Rocco Caputo.
	
2.03 2003-09-07  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org> -- minor upgrade
	* A =head[1234] command now closes any currently open =over, and
	warns.
	* Fixing a few obscure bugs, including one to do with the
	Makefile.
	* Added some tests for those bugs.
	
2.02 2003-09-02  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org> -- fixing a testing bug
	* Autrijus Tang found a silly bug of mine in corpustest.t's
	testing of corpus/t/nonesuch.txt.  Fixed,
	* I add encoding_nonesuch.t to test corpus/t/nonesuch.txt better.

	
2.01 2003-09-01  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Moved all version numbers up to 2.01 for reasons of Tibetan
	numerology.

	* Implemented =encoding.  Thanks a million to Jarkko, Autrijus,
	Dan Kogai, and many others for their help, patience, and
	encouragement.

	* It's not yet documented, but see ./t/corpus/*.txt for examples at
	least.

	* Added 'use utf8' to all the modules.  Byebye perl-5.005
	compatibility, hello decent perl-5.6 compatibility.

0.98 2003-09-01  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* At Michael Schwern's suggestion, a list that begins with a
	"=item [number]" line where number isn't a 1, is no longer
	treated as an error, but instead is silently coerced into being a
	text-item list, just as if it were "=item wubble" or whatever.
	
0.97 2003-08-12  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Loooking goooooood.  Not smelling so much like beta anymore!
	* I think this might be the last version before I go
	putting "use utf8" all over the place.

	* Added placefolders for "=encoding" support.  If you use
	"=encoding", you'll get an error about "not yet implemented"
	instead of "unknown directive".

	* Rewrote Pod::Simple::Pullparser's get_title, and added
	get_version, get_author, and get_description.  Documented them.
	Thanks to Graham Barr for contributing an initial get_title and
	then being patient while I seemed to do nothing with it for months
	on end!
	
	* More tests.
	
	* Otherwise just minor changes since last version:
		* Fixed error in Pod::Simple::RTF.
		* Added new but undocumented methods to Pod::Simple:
	           unaccept_directive(s) unaccept_target(s) unaccept_code(s)
		* Corrected '=back without =open' error to '=back without =over'
		* A little tweaking to the _verbatim_format code.
		* Dump routines may use \x{NN} instead of \xNN format.
		* Pod::Simple::HTML now uses VerbatimFormatted
		* A few changes ot DEBUG messages -- nothing you'd normally see.
	
0.96 2002-11-19  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Still kinda sorta beta.

	* Much much more docs in this version.  Only a few feature
	changes:

	* Added any_errata_seen to Pod::Simple.  Should've been in there
	ages ago.  Oops!
	* Fixed some errors in the experimental VerbatimFormatted code.
	* Added is_tagname / is_tag to Pod::Simple::PullParserStartToken
	and Pod::Simple::PullParserEndToken
	* Added RTFDEFLANG stuff to Pod::Simple::RTF.
	
0.95 2002-11-10  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>

	fatal(ish) error.

	VerbatimFormatted stuff.

	added ->tag as an alias for ->tagname.
	* Pod::Simple and Pod::Simple::BlackBox -- added tolerance for
	"=item * Foo" as a variant syntax for "=item *\n\nFoo".  Tests
	added/changed accordingly.
	* Pod::Simple::HTML -- added <a name="..."> stuff, and a hack at
	doing something with X<...>'s.

	
0.93 2002-09-29  Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>
	* Beta release.  Much documentation still to write, many features
	still to add.  The APIs might change in future versions.
