Pod::Simple

Pod::Simple is a Perl library for parsing text in the Pod ("plain old
documentation") markup language that is typically used for writing
documentation for Perl and for Perl modules. The Pod format is explained
in the <perlpod> file shipped with Perl5; the most common formatter is called
<perldoc>.

Pod formatters can use Pod::Simple to parse Pod documents and render them into
plain text, HTML, or any number of other formats.
